# Fork of SiO2 Kodi Theme

## ChangeLog
* Updated the addon.xml so it can be used in newer versions.
* For non-English regions, I added the `Arial Based` font option.
* Provide the dependency `script.artwork.downloader` in [releases](https://github.com/yzu1103309/skin.sio2/releases) (You have to manually install it in order to resolve the "dependency unmet" error)

See [commits](https://github.com/yzu1103309/skin.sio2/commits) for details of the changes I made.

If there's no suitable version in [releases](https://github.com/yzu1103309/skin.sio2/releases) for your kodi version, 
you can try modifying the files on your own to make it compatible, following steps of my commits.

* Kodi 18: xbmc.gui 5.14.0
* Kodi 19: xbmc.gui 5.15.0
* Kodi 20: xbmc.gui 5.16.0 (on my system, Kodi 20 also works with the skin when xbmc.gui version set to 5.15.0)
* Kodi 21: xbmc.gui 5.17.0
